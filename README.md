A Julia package for computing with the autologistic (Ising) probability model
and performing autologistic regression.

The package follows the treatment of this model given in the paper
[Better Autologistic Regression](https://doi.org/10.3389/fams.2017.00024).

This  package is still under development.  It does not have full functionality yet,
and has not been rigorously tested.  The intention is for this package to eventually become
an "official" Julia package registered with
[METADATA.jl](https://github.com/JuliaLang/METADATA.jl).

A detailed description of the package will be added in due course.
