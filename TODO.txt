For next release:

[ ] Finalize API.  Should the Unary, Pairwise types be removed from the API?
    [ ] more generally, understand imports/exports and get it right.
[ ] Full likelihood estimation + inference for small-n cases. 
    (use fullPMF/negpotential/pseudolikelhood code)
[ ] Pseudolikelihood estimation + bootstrap inference (need parallel for bootstrap?)
    (maybe better just to give an example of the bootstrap computation in the help, 
    in practice one might want to use parallel, not sure I want to bake that in yet.)

For future:

[ ] Add MCML inference as described in Hughes, Haran, and Caragea (2011)?
[ ] Add Bayesian inference as described in Hughes, Haran, and Caragea (2011)? (maybe not-it's impractically slow...)
[ ] Think about how partially-observed graphs (missing responses) could be handled.
[ ] Implement Swendsen-Wang (either as a MC sampler or bounding chain-type perfect
    sampler) (see Huber, 2016 book).
