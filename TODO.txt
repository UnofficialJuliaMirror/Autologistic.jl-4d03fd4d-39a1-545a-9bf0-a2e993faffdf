For next release:

[ ] Finalize API.  Should the Unary, Pairwise types be removed from the API?
    [ ] more generally, understand imports/exports and get it right.
[ ] Full likelihood estimation + inference for small-n cases. 
    (use fullPMF/negpotential/pseudolikelhood code)
[ ] Pseudolikelihood estimation + bootstrap inference (need parallel for bootstrap?)
    (maybe better just to give an example of the bootstrap computation in the help, 
    in practice one might want to use parallel, not sure I want to bake that in yet.)

For future:

[ ] Add MCML inference as described in Hughes, Haran, and Caragea (2011)?
[ ] Add Bayesian inference as described in Hughes, Haran, and Caragea (2011)? (maybe not-it's impractically slow...)
[ ] Think about how partially-observed graphs (missing responses) could be handled.
[ ] Implement Swendsen-Wang (either as a MC sampler or bounding chain-type perfect
    sampler) (see Huber, 2016 book).
[ ] Consider re-implementing parameters as arrays <: Real, instead of Float64, to allow use 
    of ForwardDiff.jl to get derivatives by automatic differentiation in optimization and Hessian
    calculation. Does it actually help optimization performance/accuracy/reliability? Any speed 
    trade-offs elsewhere due to use of generic type? Any numerical problems with existing 
    implementation that would justify the trouble of making the change?
[ ] Consider using StatsModels.DataFrameRegressionModel approach as in GLM for supplying predictors
    and responses as a DataFrame?
