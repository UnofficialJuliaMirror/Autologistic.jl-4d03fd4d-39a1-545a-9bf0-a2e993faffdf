For next release:

[ ] Finalize API.  Should the Unary, Pairwise types be removed from the API?
[ ] Pseudolikelihood estimation + inference
[ ] Bayesian estimation?
[ ] Full likelihood estimation + inference for small-n cases.

For future:

[ ] Think about how partially-observed graphs (missing responses) could be handled.
[ ] Implement Swendsen-Wang (either as a MC sampler or bounding chain-type perfect
    sampler) (see Huber, 2016 book).
